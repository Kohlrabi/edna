<h2><a name="home">What Is Edna?</a></h2>
<p>
      Edna allows you to access your MP3 collection from any networked
      computer.  This software streams your MP3 via HTTP to any MP3
      player that supports playing off a remote connection
      (Winamp/FreeAmp/Sonique).
</p>
<p>
    This software supports
    <ul>
      <li>Accessing your music collection from a remote computer.</li>
      <li>URL support to allow people to stream a specific song.</li>
      <li>
	The merging of multiple music collections while keeping the
	files on the remote computer.
      </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>How Edna Works</h2>
<p>
      Edna allows access to your MP3 directory by the web.  When a
      song is requested a stream is set up between the media player
      and the edna server.
</p>
<p>
The music collection can be accessed by

<h2><a name="server">The Edna Server</a></h2>
<p>
      The edna server is a very stable Python program that can be
      launched in several ways.
</p>
<ol>
<li>As a command line python script.</li>
<li>As a NT Service</li>
<li>As a Windows Taskbar Service</li>
</ol>

<h3>Command Line</h3>
<p>
      Start the program by typing <i>./edna.py</i> on a machine with
      Python installed.  If doing this from a remote terminal, try the
      command <i>./nohup edna.py</i> to allow the server to continue
      running even after the connection is closed.
</p>
<p><center><img src="images/term.jpg" width=454 height=70 alt="" border="0"></center>

<h3>As an NT Service</h3>
<p>
   You also need the most recent Win32 extensions, and have NT 4.0, or 
   Windows 2000 for this code to work.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt><strong>Installation</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    <code>python ednaNTSvc.py -c <var>path to edna.conf</var> --startup auto install</code>
    <p></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><strong>Removal</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    <code>python ednaNTSvc.py remove</code>
    <p></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><strong>Official usage string output by ednaNTSvc.py</strong></dt>
<dd><small><pre>   Usage: 'ednaNTSvc.py [options] install|update|remove|start [...]|stop|restart [...]|debug [...]' 
   Options for 'install' and 'update' commands only:
    --username domain\username : The Username the service is to run under
    --password password : The password for the username
    --startup [manual|auto|disabled] : How the service starts, default = manual
</pre></small></dd>
</dl>

<h3>As a Windows Taskbar Service</h3>
<p>
Simply execute <code>edna.exe</code>.  You should notice that an icon
appears in the taskbar.  This is the edna server running in the
background.

<h2><a name="client">The Edna Clients</a></h2>

<h3>Web Browser</h3>
<p>
To view the edna server within a Web Browser, type the IP address of
the server followed by a colon and the port the server is running on.
If the edna server is configured to run on port 8000 and your ip
address is 12.34.56.789, you would go visit
<i>http://12.34.56.789:8000</i>
</p>

<h3>Edna Client</h3>
<p>
Creating a specialized client has provides the user with benefits over
the use of a web browser.  Some of the enhancements include
<ul>
<li>A better understanding of where you are on the edna server</li>
<li>A clearer distinction between songs and folders</li>
<li>A way to play/enqueue songs from different folders</li>
<li>A way to play/enqueue albums from different Artists</li>
<li>The ability to play files from different servers</li>
<li>The ability to see what servers are available</li>
<li>A way to &lt; ctrl &gt; select the songs you want to play</li>
</ul>

The client is built with Python and the wxPython cross platform GUI
toolkit.  Instructions on adding your own features are here, and you
can download it here.

<h2><a name="edit">Editing the source</a></h2>
<p>
      The server code is found in <code>edna.py</code>.  Take a look
      at the code and you should be able to add your own features
      without much hassle.
</p>
<p>
      Edna also has some code in it to extract ID3 tags from MP3
      files.  I'm not using it yet, but will add some code to display
      the data on the generated web pages.  I might also look into
      using some kind of template mechanism for generating the web
      pages.  A number of people have requested access lists to
      protect their files, so I'll be adding that soon, too.  If you
      have a pet feature, then please let me know!
</p>
<p>
      The client code can be found in edna_gui.py.  Most of the code
      was gui code was done in <a
      href="http://www.wxPython.org/">wxPython</a>.  The nice thing is
      that you don't need to have python installed on your system to
      edit the code.  If you are running the edna.exe and have the
      python15.dll on your system, you modify any of the files within
      the app directory.
</p>

<h2><a name="download">Download</a></h2>

<p>
Edna is licensed under the
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>. It is a small <a
href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> script. At the moment, it is
about 1000 lines (version 0.1 was only 250!). You can view the thing
online, or grab the distribution. edna is checked into a CVS
repository and is available for
<a href="http://www.lyra.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/edna/">viewing
			    with your web browser</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The server should work for any platform. I've tested it on Linux and
  Windows. I've been using Internet Explorer and WinAmp (on Windows)
  to navigate the pages and play the files.

<h2><a name="configure">Configuration</a></h2>
<h3>Server</h3>
<p>
  Edit the <code>edna.conf</code> file with your setup. This is simple
  to do, as all you need to tell it is:
</p>
<ol>
<li>what port to run on 
<li>the directories for your MP3 files 
</ol>

<h3>Client</h3>
<p>
  Edit the <code>edna_gui.conf</code> file with your setup.  You need
  to tell the client:
</p>
<ol>
<li>What servers you want to connect to
<li>The path to your mp3 player
</ol>
