      This is a quick hack that I put together, based on ideas from my
      friend,
      <a href="http://www.cybersnot.com/"><i>Geoff Elliott</i></a>.
      He had written a program named ampRadio that operates much like
      <strong>edna</strong> -- serving up HTML pages with links to MP3
      files, and then serving out those MP3s.

	Jeffrey Griffith has put together a <a href="./beta/">revised
	version of this web site</a>.
      <br>

      It isn't ready for prime time, but may have information that
      interests you. We would also welcome any feedback about the
      site. We're still shuffling stuff around, so you may also want
      to visit
      <a href="http://www.auburn.edu/~griffjm/edna/">Jeffrey's edna
	pages</a>
      for extra tidbits. Greg is off on vacation and will update this
      stuff at the beginning of October.

    <p>
      <strong>edna</strong> is currently labeled as <em>version
	0.3</em> because there are still a few more features that I
      would like to
      add. It is <em>very</em> stable and can be used (now) without a
      problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      While any silly web server can do this (serve up MP3s), there
      are two cool features about <strong>edna</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	The pages are dynamically constructed, adjusting to directory
	structure and the files in those directories.  This is much
	nicer than using simple directory indexing. While the dynamic
	file list could be done with various CGI or PHP-like tools,
	the dynamic directories would be a lot harder.
      </li>
      <li>
	This is the coolest part... Rather than directly serving up an
	MP3, the software serves up a <em>playlist</em>. This gets
	passed to your player (e.g. WinAmp) which turns around with an
	HTTP request to <em>stream</em> the MP3. I must give credit to
	Geoff for this one :-)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      When constructing a page for a directory, <strong>edna</strong>
      will list all
      subdirectories, MP3 song files (.mp3 extensions), playlists
      (.m3u extensions), and certain other types of music files (such
      as .wav). All other files will be ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>edna</strong> can automatically create play lists for
      individual
      directories of songs, and all directories recursively. These
      lists can also be shuffled (by <strong>edna</strong>, rather
      than your player).
    </p>
    <p>
      Your MP3 player must be able to recognize .m3u files, and your
      browser must know to pass .m3u files to your player. Your player
      must be capable of handling URLs within a playlist. I've tested
      this with WinAmp, which definitely meets these needs.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'd also like to thank
      <a href="mailto:lowe@centre.edu">Andy Lowe</a>
      for submitting the patches for recursive play lists.
      <a href="mailto:billtut@microsoft.com">Bill Tutt</a> has
      provided some excellent patches, too; version 0.4 will include
      his patches to turn <strong>edna</strong> into a Win32 Service.
    </p>

    <hr align=left width="30&#37;">
    <h2>Can I have the source?</h2>
    <p>
      Sure. <strong>edna</strong> is licensed under the
      <a href="http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html"><i>GPL</i></a>.
      It is a small
      <a href="http://www.python.org/"><i>Python</i></a> script. At
      the moment, it is about 500 lines (version 0.1
      was only 250!). You can view
      the thing
      <a href="edna.py">online</a>, or grab the
      <a href="edna-0.3.tar.gz">distribution</a>.
      <strong>edna</strong> is checked into a CVS repository and is
      available for
      <a href="/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/edna/">viewing with your web 
	browser</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The server should work for any platform. I've tested it on
      Linux and Windows. I've been using Internet Explorer and WinAmp
      (on Windows) to navigate the pages and play the files.
    </p>

    <hr align=left width="30&#37;">
    <h2>Installation and Use</h2>
    <p>
      Using <strong>edna</strong> is boringly simple. Make sure you
      have Python 1.5 installed on your system. Edit the
      <code>edna.conf</code> file with your setup. This is simple to
      do, as all you need to tell it is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>what port to run on</li>
      <li>the directories for your MP3 files</li>
      <li>optionally, how to log requests</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Then, simply run <code>edna.py</code>. This can be done using:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <code>% python edna.py</code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      It will then go into an infinite loop, serving up pages and
      files. Hit ctrl-C to stop it.
    </p>

    <hr align=left width="30&#37;">
    <h2>Modifications</h2>
    <p>
      If you don't like the HTML it generates, then look at
      <code>edna.py</code>. You should be able to figure out how to
      change it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm quite willing to accept patches or other fixes. Just
      email them to me at
      <a href="mailto:gstein@lyra.org">gstein@lyra.org</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>edna</strong> has some code in it to extract ID3 tags
      from MP3 files. I'm not using it yet, but will add some code to
      display the data on the generated web pages. I might also look
      into using some kind of template mechanism for generating the
      web pages. A number of people have requested access lists to
      protect their files, so I'll be adding that soon, too. If you
      have a pet feature, then please let me know!
    </p>

    <hr align=left width="30&#37;">
    <h4>Threading vs Forking</h4>
    <p>
      By default, <strong>edna</strong> will use a threading mechanism
      to serve out requests. If threading support is not available on
      your platform (the OS doesn't support it, or Python was built
      without it), then edna will default to forking processes to
      serve requests. No big deal, but I mention it since edna-0.1 did
      not fall-back to forking when threading was not available. As of
      edna-0.2, it will figure out the right thing to do.
    </p>
