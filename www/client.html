    <h1>edna Client Software</h1>

    <p>
      <font color=red><strong>The client is still being developed and
	  is not currently available.</strong></font>
    </p>

    <p>
      Normally, edna interacts with users through web pages. However,
      edna also provides the ability for a custom GUI client to access
      the songs and playlists from the edna server, while interacting
      with the user in a more natural fashion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is a screenshot of the edna client:

    <h2>Client benefits</h2>
    <p>
      Creating a specialized client has provides the user with
      benefits over the use of a web browser.  Some of the
      enhancements include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A better understanding of where you are on the edna server</li>
      <li>A clearer distinction between songs and folders</li>
      <li>A way to play/enqueue songs from different folders</li>
      <li>A way to play/enqueue albums from different Artists</li>
      <li>The ability to play files from different servers</li>
      <li>The ability to see what servers are available</li>
      <li>A way to &lt; ctrl &gt; select the songs you want to play</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The client is built with Python and the wxPython cross platform
      GUI toolkit.  Instructions on adding your own features are here,
      and you can download it here.
    </p>

    <h2>Editing the edna client</h2>
    <p>
      The client code can be found in edna_gui.py.  Most of the code
      was gui code was done in
      <a href="http://www.wxPython.org/">wxPython</a>.  The nice thing
      is that you don't need to have python installed on your system
      to edit the code.  If you are running the edna.exe and have the
      python15.dll on your system, you modify any of the files within
      the app directory.
    </p>

    <h2>Download</h2>
    <p>
      <i>The client code is not available at this time. Please check
	back in the future.</i>
    </p>

    <h2>Client configuration</h2>
    <p>
      Edit the <code>edna_gui.conf</code> file with your setup.  You
      need to tell the client:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>What servers you want to connect to</li>
      <li>The path to your mp3 player</li>
    </ol>
